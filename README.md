### Business Problems we have tried to solve in this project:

1. **Customer Segmentation Challenge:**
   - Problem: XYZ Corporation struggles to identify and categorize its top and bottom-performing customers in each state.
   - Solution: Utilized SQL window functions to rank and categorize customers based on sales metrics, enabling targeted marketing efforts.

2. **Marketing Optimization:**
   - Problem: XYZ needs to optimize marketing efforts by targeting specific customer groups within each state.
   - Solution: Leveraged NTILE function to divide customers into groups, facilitating focused marketing strategies for different segments.

3. **Revenue Disparity Investigation:**
   - Problem: XYZ wants to understand why some customers generate below-average revenue in certain states.
   - Solution: Used SQL window functions to calculate average revenue per state and identify customers with revenue below the state average.

4. **Resource Allocation Dilemma:**
   - Problem: XYZ Corporation is uncertain about how to efficiently allocate resources across states based on customer count.
   - Solution: Employed window functions to determine the total number of customers in each state, aiding in strategic resource distribution.

5. **Real-time Sales Monitoring:**
   - Problem: XYZ Corporation seeks a real-time view of sales performance, particularly running totals for specific customers.
   - Solution: Utilized window functions for running total analysis, providing insights into sales trends over time for targeted decision-making.

6. **Previous and Next Sales Analysis:**
   - Problem: Understanding customer purchasing patterns, especially analyzing previous and next sales values.
   - Solution: Implemented Lag and Lead functions to examine the sales history of specific customers, aiding in predicting future sales trends.

7. **Performance Evaluation - Lag in Response:**
   - Problem: XYZ Corporation experiences delays in retrieving customer information, impacting decision-making.
   - Solution: Assess the performance of customer data retrieval using the EXPLAIN command to identify potential optimization opportunities.

Note :- These business problems showcase how SQL window functions can address specific challenges, from customer segmentation and marketing optimization to resource allocation and real-time sales monitoring.
